# tyranny-of-dragons
Maps for the [D&D 5e](https://dnd.wizards.com/) module [Tyranny of Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/tyranny-dragons).

## VTT Notes
These maps are made to a 50px grid, they are not scaled to roll20, sorry about your luck I use [Planar Ally](https://github.com/kruptein/planarally).

## License
These maps are drawn using [Dungeondraft](https://dungeondraft.net/) using the stock assets which allow me to share these mapos with you, the community.

## Why are these free? How can I pay you because I totally love you!
I believe my work is not 100% faithful to the WotC maps, if you love bacon like I do you can [support me on patreon](https://www.patreon.com/10leej)
